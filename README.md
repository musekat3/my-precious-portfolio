My Precious Portfolio 

This is my webpage portfolio. 

* Portfolio
I have created this portfolio using the the lessons that we learned about HTML, CSS, and Advanced CSS. 

* Website
This website should be used to see my portfolio and to contact me (when I have that properly set up). 

* Themes 
I have decided to make this website themed to hopefully stand out a little bit. I haven't added much information as I am still learning every day. 

* Sections 
My webpage currently includes the sections of: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me 

* Surprise! 
Just a heads-up. I have added a media player at the bottom left of the webpage that will play a mp3 file to add to the experience of viewing my portfolio.
